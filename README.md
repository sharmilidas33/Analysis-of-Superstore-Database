# Analysis-of-Superstore-Database
The project focuses on a comprehensive examination of the SuperStore dataset to gain valuable insights and identify areas for improvement.  It begins with data exploration and preprocessing to ensure data quality and integrity. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) uncovers meaningful patterns and key performance metrics from sales data. Geographical sales analysis is performed to identify potential target markets, aiding in marketing and expansion strategies. Additionally, a regression-based machine learning model is developed for profit prediction, and data-driven recommendations are presented to optimize decision-making processes and enhance overall SuperStore performance.
